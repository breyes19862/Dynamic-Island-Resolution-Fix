(MacOS only. Cowperation files can only be used with Cowabunga Lite MacOS)

And apply the tweak

With the release of iOS/iPadOS 18.1 Developer Beta 5, SparseRestore - the backup-based exploit used in Nugget (pc, mobile), MisakaX, MitokoX, PureKFD/PureiOS and AIEnabler has been patched.

You can still use Cowabunga Lite?, but no more Apple Intelligence, gestalt editing (no dynamic island, etc), or bypassing EU restrictions... on iOS/iPadOS 18.1 Developer Beta 5 and higher.

You can update safely, but you will lose Apple Intelligence, and other aforementioned things. If you do update, ideally revert your Gestalt file before doing so (resolution changes, spoofed device models) to prevent any further issues.
